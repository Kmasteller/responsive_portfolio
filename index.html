			<p>I am a life long learner who loves a good challenge. This can be attributed to growing up as the youngest of four boys. At an early age I learned that if I wanted something, I would have to fight for it and often times I found myself working hard to get it, even if it wasn't the easiest path for me.</p>
			<p>After high school, I took an alternative route, went straight to work and started spending all my spare cash on traveling. I got into home health, moved to Florida and started working for some affluent people. This gave me an opportunity to move to France, despite having studied German in high school, where I managed a property for a group of retired Americans.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately my boss passed away and in my mid-twenties, I moved back to Utah, determined to supplement my worldly education with a scholarly one. I worked full time through my undergraduate and graduate degree, ultimately acheiving a B.A in Communication (3.81 GPA) and an MBA in Management (GPA 3.97). Always striving to improve myself; I am now enrolled in a bootcamp for web development at the University of Utah.</p>
			<p>Having spent 10 years with my current employer, since returning to Utah, I have moved up the ranks as I learned the ins and outs of Marketing. It is now that I find myself at another crossroad, looking left and right, but always moving forward.</p>
